  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

  <p>
    I'm 26 years old and live on Amager with my partner and our dog. I have a
    sales apprenticeship from Samsøe Samsøe, which means I have experience in
    the sales and retail industry. My interest and competence in sales and the
    business world reflect my personality and passion for working with people
    and solutions. I started the Multimedia Design program with the goal of
    working in creative and alternative fields. I have an interest in everything
    that goes into website development, and I want to refine my design skills.
